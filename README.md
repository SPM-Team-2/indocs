_**Document Scanner App which runs in your browser**_

## Introduction 

As the documents move from physical to digital medium, a document scanner is much needed. But a document scanner, being a utility app, isn't used on a daily basis. People either delete the app right after completing the scan or it stays on the device, dormant, consuming precious memory. We sought out to find a way to tackle this issue and came up with InDocs - A Scanner app which works in the device browser, and hence doesn't require any additional space on the device.
